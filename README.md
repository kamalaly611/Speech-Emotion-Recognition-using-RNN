## Introduction
This project focuses on Speech Emotion Recognition using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It utilizes the Librosa library for audio feature extraction, including pitch and tone, from audio files.

## Installation
To install this project:
1. Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Install Librosa using `!pip install librosa`.

## Usage
Run the main Python script to start the emotion recognition process. Ensure audio files are in the correct format and directory as specified in the script.

## Features
- Audio feature extraction using Librosa.
- Emotion recognition from audio files using RNN.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Librosa
- Matplotlib
- Other Python libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`.

## Configuration
No additional configuration is needed apart from the installation of required Python libraries.

## Documentation
The project includes inline comments for better understanding and ease of use.

## Examples
1. Load an audio file using Librosa: `data, sampling_rate = librosa.load('/path/to/audio')`.
2. Visualize audio waves: Use Matplotlib and Librosa's display module.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify audio file paths and formats.
- For any errors, check the stack trace for details.
